- **Transparent, but thoughtfully:** Patagonia makes a big deal about transparency. From supply chain to cash register, Patagonia presents as upfront, honest, and accountable. Patagonia is definitely not shying away from their earth-friendly mission. It’s all over. But they know when and how to deploy information about their mission without overwhelming the customer. They create spaces for customers at every level of engagement, without letting people off the hook.
   
- **Trustworthy:** The hihg level of transparency leaves no space for doubt about trusting the brand. Their mission to reduce harm to the environment and to help rebuild it is clear and well communicated. What resonates with Patagonia customers is that the company doesn’t just talk the environmental talk. Its founder Yvon Chouinard, an accomplished rock climber, also backs up the company’s talk with its actions.

Here is an email introducing a new line of work apparel:
> We set out to build a Workwear line — jackets, pants, sweaters, shirts and hats — that is more durable and uses less harmful materials. Our design process begins with the basic elements — innovative hemp blends or warm, superdurable synthetics — and from there we add exactly what is necessary for the specific end use.
