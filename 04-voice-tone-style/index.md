Voice, tone, and content. They need to match and build off of one another. Patagonia continually reinforces itself as a brand rooted in transparency in each of its communication channels. And by creating a brand voice that is trustworthy and educational, the customer is led on a consistent brand journey.

## Voice

1. Transparent, but thoughtfully: Patagonia makes a big deal about transparency. From supply chain to cash register, Patagonia presents as upfront, honest, and accountable. Patagonia is definitely not shying away from their earth-friendly mission. It’s all over. But they know when and how to deploy information about their mission without overwhelming the customer. They create spaces for customers at every level of engagement, without letting people off the hook.

Here is an email introducing a new line of work apparel:
> We set out to build a Workwear line — jackets, pants, sweaters, shirts and hats — that is more durable and uses less harmful materials. Our design process begins with the basic elements — innovative hemp blends or warm, superdurable synthetics — and from there we add exactly what is necessary for the specific end use.
