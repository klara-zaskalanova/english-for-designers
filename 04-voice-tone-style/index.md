# My voice, tone, and style 

### I want my voice to be:

**Polite**

  I don't curse. If you want to send a text on my behalf and you'll use vulgarisms, you won't succeed in this role.

### Tone

Casual:

Formal: If I write a formal e-mail, it is really structured 

### Style

**Emojis**

I don't use them. My closest people would often ask, why do I sound so mad when texting. I write the same as I speak, but my messages lack intonation and mimics, therefore they happen to be misinterpreted. To avoid inducing this impression, I do actually use emojis with people who use them too. 



Hello, I'm Kl√°ra. I started in...

I care about our environment. I organized School Strikes Fridays for Future. /picture of me at strike on the podium/ When I am supposed to give a talk or a presentation, my heart pulse is like 200. So I still don't really believe I've done it. I care about politics and I am close to activism.

I am currantly working at my bachelor thesis. I am working at slowing down. I am learning how to do less. I am becoming more self confident. I am working on strenghtening my muscles and stretching my tendons.
