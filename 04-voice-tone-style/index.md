# My voice, tone, and style 

## Voice

**Polite:** I don't curse. If you want to send a text on my behalf and you'll use vulgarisms, you won't succeed in this role.
  
**Honest:** I strive to be straightforward. I am learning how to say *no* and how to express even the negative opinions in polite way. I reckon everyone deserves honesty. Beating about the bush or making excuses is just wasting ones time.

**People-Pleasing (unfortunately):** When getting to the point, I subconsciously tend to overexplain the reasons and all the circumstances that led to my desicions. 

  <!-- The other side of my honesty is that I sometimes don't know the border line...I sometimes don't know how to serve the information in appropriate way -->

## Tone

**Kind:** When I talk, 80% of the time I smile. I want people to know I listen to them and I am interested in what they have to say. I also don't jump into conclusions but remind myself, that I don't know what's behind people's behaviour so I can't jugde them.

**Over-sharing. Or maybe just sharing:** I am really a fan of people communiacating their feelings. I think it's extremly calming when people hear, that it's not just them feeling a certain way, and tha it's all right. That you can have fear and still do the thing you are afraid of. Sharing ones fears and worries can show others that we're all humanas. It sounds like a huge clish√©, but I think this abilty is in general still lacking.

**Assertive:** When needed, I am the one who asks the question or raises the complaint. 

## Style

**Don't use emojis:** My closest peers would often ask, why do I sound so mad when texting. I write the same as I speak, but my messages lack intonation and mimics, therefore they happen to be misinterpreted. To avoid inducing this impression, I do actually use emojis with people who use them too, or who are not yet that close to me.

**Don't use ALL CAPS:** When emphasising within body text, I usually use **bold**, sometimes *italics*, but not ALL CAPS. They sound like shouting...

**Standards of formal writing:** My e-mails are really structured. When writing in formal sphere, I meet all the rules of text hierarchy etc. I am also very punctual when it comes to grammar.
