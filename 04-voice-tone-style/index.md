# My voice, tone, and style 

### I want my voice to be:

**Polite**

  I don't curse. If you want to send a text on my behalf and you'll use vulgarisms, you won't succeed in this role.


### Style

**Emojis**

I don't use them. My closest people would often ask, why do I sound so mad when texting. I write the same as I speak, but my messages lack intonation and mimics, therefore they happen to be misinterpreted. To avoid inducing this impression, I do actually use emojis with people who use them too.
