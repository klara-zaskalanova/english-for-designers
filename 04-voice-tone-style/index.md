# My voice, tone, and style 

*I want my voice to be:*

1. **Polite**

  I don't curse. If you want to send a text on my behalf and you'll use vulgarisms, you won't succeed in this role.

2. **Honest**
  
  I strive to be straightforward. I am learning how to say no and to express even the negative opinions in polite way. I reckon everyone deserves honesty. Beating about the bush or making excuses is just wasting ones time.

*I don't want my voice to be, but it is:*

3. **People-Pleasing**

When getting to the point, I subconsciously tend to overexplain the reasons and all the circumstances that led to my desicions. 

  <!-- The other side of my honesty is that I sometimes don't know the border line...I sometimes don't know how to serve the information in appropriate way -->

### Tone

**Supportive**



Formal: 

### Style

**Don't use emojis**

I don't use them. My closest peers would often ask, why do I sound so mad when texting. I write the same as I speak, but my messages lack intonation and mimics, therefore they happen to be misinterpreted. To avoid inducing this impression, I do actually use emojis with people who use them too, or who are not yet that close to me.

**Don't use ALL CAPS**

When emphasising within body text, I usually use **bold**, sometimes *italics*, but not ALL CAPS. They sound like shouting...

**Standards of formal writing**

If write a formal e-mail, it is really structured. When writing in formal sphere, I meet all the rules of text hierarchy etc.
