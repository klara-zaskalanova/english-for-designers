1. Transparent, but thoughtfully – Patagonia makes a big deal about transparency. From supply chain to cash register, Patagonia presents as upfront, honest, and accountable. Patagonia knows, when when and how to deploy information about their mission. Patagonia is definitely not shying away from their earth-friendly mission. It’s all over. But they create spaces for customers at every level of engagement, without letting people off the hook. 
2. Trustworthy
3. Educational

Here is an email introducing a new line of work apparel:
> We set out to build a Workwear line — jackets, pants, sweaters, shirts and hats — that is more durable and uses less harmful materials. Our design process begins with the basic elements — innovative hemp blends or warm, superdurable synthetics — and from there we add exactly what is necessary for the specific end use.
