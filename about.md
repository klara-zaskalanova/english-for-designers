## My journey

I started to notice all the visual faux pas during my time on high school… It got on my nerves when I entered non-intuitive website, and my heart skipped a beat when I entered a great one. That was when I realised I want to work in a creative field. I started studying Graphic design at University of Creative Communication in Prague and now, while still studying, I am starting my career as  a digital (UX/UI) and graphic designer. I want to make the online and offline spaces less complicated, more intuitive. Less cluttered, more esthetic.

I help with graphic design, web / app design and user experiences. (i don't like this sentence, should edit it)

## What I live for

When I am not studying or with my nose in design, you’ll find me clearing my mind in nature. Whether it is a forest behind our house or the big mountains further away, hiking is important for me. In Prague, you can find parks or small forests within the city. But in the central Slovakia, where I come from, it’s the other way round. It’s more like, you can find small towns between the forests.

### More mountain pictures

In my family, I'm the first of four children, and even though I'm not the one who is considered a photographer, I still think I have a feel for nice shots.  I usually don’t want to lug any heavier device with me than my phone. But sometimes I push it and take my analog camera with me, which makes the pictures more valuable.
