> You are always late.

Whenever I had a small or sometimes bigger argument with my dad, I’d often say something like that. And then sometimes I’d say:

> Every-time we argue, you don’t listen to what I have to say.

Or:
> You always say this. You always say that.

And so on. It was _always_ something.

When hearing the word **always**, I notice it much more than other words. It's a word my father taught me to be cautious about.  Now, I don’t want you to think I argue with my dad a lot. I love him. But like in every family, and like in every parent-child relationship, we happen to have disagreements. When I used a sentence with always in it, he would remind me, and say:
  
> Be careful when using always. And *never*, *every time*, or *constantly* — they can easily cause harm to a person you are talking with.

My dad’s a psychologist. And he does a lot of couples therapy. So this simple advice is one that he repeats often. By throwing the word always into a relationship conversation, you could cause unintentional hurt to a partner, friend, or family member in a split second. Simply — because because it’s likely, that your statement is not true. And by accusing your partner of “always” interrupting you or “always” leaving the lights on, you automatically put them in defense mode. And as simple as that, you’ve started or escalated an argument. So, instead of making the situation worse by *always*, try to use a a different tone: 

> I don’t like it when you interrupt me.

> It hurts me, when you are watching TV while I’m talking to you.

> Please, could you turn the lights off when you leave the room, thank you.

After my dad corrected me around three times when I used this word, I started to be really sensitive to it. And not even that much while hearing it from others, but while using it myself. Every time I catch myself using it, I am like _No, not that word_. I immediately have the urge to correct myself and I also do so. Because I realise, that it is not true.
