- [Rheumatic Diseases With Chill](#rheumatic-diseases-with-chil-(revma-v-klidu))
  
  Online educational and motivational course for people with rheumatic diseases. It is being created by Czech.digital (ÄŒesko.digital), volunteer community of profesionals. I worked as a part of UX team together with developers, marketers, copywriters, graphic designer and the client themselves.

- [Aura Cake Architect](#aura-cake-architect)

  Brand strategy with visual identitiy for patisserie. I came up with an idea, that Aura is not just about desserts. It is about slowing down. Stopping for a moment and fully enjoying it. Customers should focus on every taste and every texture on the tongue. This will help them to  enjoy not just the dessert, but the moment itself.

The course is **one of its kind** in Czech Republic. It will spread awareness of the disease and motivate patients to physical exercise at home. It will help people, who can't afford exercising with professional assistance in a long-term.

In order to understand the needs and mainly the restrictions of our users we asked them about changes in their life after diagnoses. About treatment, about their relationship with physical exercise and about their digital literacy.

I gained the experience of **in-depth user interviews** and **user testing**, worked in a interdisciplinary team with another **13 people** and once again found my sense for the tiniest detail.

Project will be launched in January 2024, so stay tuned!
